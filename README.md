# Road Segmentation Tool (RST)

## Tool to create binary labels of FPV road/street videos

Create binary segmentation maps from closed polygons using linear, quadratic and cubic splines to segment the road surface from the background. The main window runs an event loop that parses mouse callbacks and key-presses to perform different actions. The back-end continually loads in video frames from a local video and writes the labeled binary maps to a video file
